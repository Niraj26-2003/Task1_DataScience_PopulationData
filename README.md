# Task1_DataScience_PopulationData
This project visualizes global population data by country from 1990 to 2023 using bar charts and histograms.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
- **Bar Chart**: Top 10 most populous countries in 2023
- **Histogram**: Distribution of 2023 population across all countries
## ðŸ“Œ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
 ## ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion
#Conclusion(Histogram): Age Distribution Most individuals are aged 25, making it the peak.
Ages 20â€“40 dominate, indicating a younger population.
A spike at age 0/1 may reflect infants or missing data.
Few elderly individuals (age 60+).
Age range spans 0 to 115, but higher ages are rare.

Conclusion(Bar Chart): Gender Distribution The dataset contains slightly more males than females.
Males â‰ˆ 12,500, Females â‰ˆ 11,500 (approximate).
Overall, the gender distribution is fairly balanced.
